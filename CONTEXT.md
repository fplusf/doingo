# Important features to focus on:

Adding a Task: Wireframe the process of adding a new task, including the input fields for task name, description, due date, and potentially tags. This should incorporate the "Task Translator" concept from CONTEXT.md, where users can input vague goals and the AI suggests actionable steps.
Task Breakdown: Wireframe how a task is broken down into smaller subtasks, both manually by the user and automatically by the AI. This should visualize the "Focus Mode" with expanding task view and the AI-driven auto-chunking.
Focus Mode (Pomodoro Timer): Wireframe the "Focus Mode" screen, including the adaptable Pomodoro timer, visual time awareness elements (sand timer, growing tree, etc.), and integration with distraction blockers.
Task Details Page: Wireframe the task details page, including the "Document," "Both," and "Canvas" views. This should show how users can view and edit task details, notes, and the visual representation (Excalidraw integration).
Reminders Page: Wireframe the dedicated page for reminders, showing how users can create, view, edit, and delete reminders. This should include the integration with Apple Reminders and the ability to convert reminders to tasks.
Calendar Integration: Wireframe how calendar events are displayed and how users can convert them to tasks.
